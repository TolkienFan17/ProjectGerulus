# About

This project began as a simple demo for SQL Injection attacks, but it has turned into a project developing an educational tool for showing students symmetrical encryption and Diffie-Helman.

### User Stories

- As an end-user, I want my inbox to be protected with a login so that only I can read my inbox.
- As a demo presenter, I want the login to be vulnerable to SQL Injection so that I show off the vulnerability in the demo.
- As a teacher, I want messages to be encrypted with diffie-hellman so that students can learn in a tactile fashion about it.
- As a developer, I want to eventually migrate to Entity Framework so that it is easier to maintain and develop.
- As a new user, I want to be able to easily create a new account so that it is easy to start playing around the program and so that there are unique ways of playing around with it using multiple accounts.
- As a developer, I want the UI to be in the console so that I don't have to invest a lot of time and effort designing and implementing a nice UI.
- As an end-user, I want to remove messages from my inbox so that it doesn't become too long.
- As a developer, I want to hash the passwords using a modern algorithm so that the login is protected and to experiment with something new.
- As a teacher, I want students to be able to connect to each other so that I can setup labs around man in the middle attacks on diffie-hellman.
- As a teacher, if there is any server component, I want it to be easy-to-use and lightweight, so that I don't have to invest a lot of time setting it up for each lab.
- As a student, I want to be able to change my key so that I can see how it works in a transparent fashion.
